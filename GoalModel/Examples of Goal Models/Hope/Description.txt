The goal model describes an application to provide emotional support to those people who need it is to be developed. There are three stakeholders (actors): the end User who wants advice, the Counselor who provides advice, and the Organization who provides the application. 

The goal of the user is to get help. At the time of receiving help, the user is interested in receiving an immediate response, feeling comfortable with the service, and wishing for anonymity. The goal of the counselor is to provide counseling. He is interested in providing a quality counseling, which will help him to feel satisfied with the help provided, he is also interested in help as many people as possible but avoiding getting stressed. The goal of the organization is to offer emotional help. The organization is interested in offering help immediately which will help in providing a quality counseling, guarantee the security of the application to avoid scandals which will help to increase the funds, hence be able to help as many people as possible.

When it comes to achieving the goals of the stakeholders (get help, provide counseling and offer emotional help) the application offers two alternatives, or the communication is done through chat (T1) or video chat (T2). Each of the alternatives in which the goals can be achieved have an impact on the different interests of the stakeholders. This impact is represented by the contribution relationships. For example, using video chat helps provide higher quality counseling from counselors.
