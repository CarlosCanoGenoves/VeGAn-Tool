The goal model describes an application of online education that facilitates access to education to be developed. There are three stakeholders (actors): the end User that wants to learn, the Company that wants to train its workers, and the Teacher that wants to provide the course.

The goal of the user is to learn. At the time of learning, the user is interested in receiving a quality course and feeling satisfied with the course. In addition, the user is also interested in having flexible schedules with respect to the course to be able to do it when it suits him as well as the possibility of avoiding displacement. The goal of the company is to train its working force  in order to increase productivity, for which it will help to provide quality courses (S3). The company is also interested in reducing training costs because it has many workers to train. The goal of the teacher is to provide courses, being interested in increasing access to education, so offering students to take courses from anywhere and at any time seems interesting to them. However, they are concerned about student participation in class, as well as possible technical problems they may have when using an application.

When it comes to achieving the goals of the stakeholders (learn, train workers, and provide course) has two alternatives, or the course is provided face-to-face or online. Each of the alternatives in which the goals can be achieved have an impact on the different interests of the stakeholders. This impact is represented by the contribution relationships. For example, online courses help to provide education anywhere from the teacher.
