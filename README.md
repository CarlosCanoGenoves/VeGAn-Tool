# VeGAn-Tool

The VeGAn-Tool (Value-based goal-oriented analysis) automates an approach that analyzes goal models through the concept of value, on the basis of a relative qualitative importance so as to identify which goals are most valuable to the stakeholders. The approach considers not only the individual importance of intentional elements but also their relationships in the whole goal model, independently of whether or not they can be satisfied.

This tool was supported by the grant TIN2017-84550-R (Adapt@Cloud project) funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and the “Programa de Ayudas de Investigación y Desarrollo” (PAID-01-17) from the Universitat Politècnica de València.
