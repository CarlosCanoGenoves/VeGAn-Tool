# Quick Start

##  1. Prerequisites:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)

##  2. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn/releases)

##  3. Execute VeGAn.jar:

To run the application you can either double-left-click on the VeGAn.jar file or run the following command from a terminal:

```java -jar VeGAn.jar```

The following [video](https://youtu.be/N4j8W6QeWww) shows an example of using the application.


# Building VeGAn

##  1. Prerequisites:
* [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)
* [Java JDK 17 or newer](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Eclipse Modeling Tools](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2023-03/r/eclipse-modeling-tools): It is important to download the Eclipse version of modeling tools as it includes the plugins needed to compile the application.

* [Eclipse OCL Plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-ocl) **OPTIONAL**: The ecore metamodel includes OCL to validate the models in xmi as well as to generate some derived attributes. This plugin is not necessary to use the application, but it is recommended if you want to create new goal models since it can indicate errors and derived attributes help to better understand the model.


##  2. Descargar & Importar

### 2.1. Clone the source code:

`git clone https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn.git`

### 2.2. Open Eclipse Modeling Tools

### 2.3. Import the code into Eclipse

File -> Import...

General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Root directory -> Select the folder in which the source code was downloaded

## 4. Structure

The project structure is as follows:

* **model**: Contains the ecore metamodel used by the application.

***

* **src/goalModel**, **src/goalModel.impl**, **src/goalModel.util**: Contains the java implementation of the metamodel generated by genmodel.
* **src/VEGAN**: Contains the implementation of the VeGAn technique.
* **src/VISUAL**: Contains the interface part of the application.
* **src/piStar**: Contains the implementation of the model import of the piStar tool.

***

* **test**: Contains jUnit Test of the application.
* **testModels**: Contains models used for unit test.
* **piStar**: Contains models from the piStar application for testing.

## 5. Build & Execute

To compile and run the application you must right-click on **src/VISUAL/Visual.java** and select the option: Run As ->Java Application

The following [video](https://youtu.be/N4j8W6QeWww) shows an example of using the application.
