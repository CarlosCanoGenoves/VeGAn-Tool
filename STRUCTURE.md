# Project structure

The eclipse project is structured in three sections:

* Metamodel: Contains the goal model metamodel that is used by the tool.
* Technique: Contains the implementation of the goal-oriented analysis technique including the interface and import of piStar models
* Testing: Contains the tests used to verify the tool, contains both the tests and the models used to test the tool.

## Metamodel

* [model](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/model): Contains the ecore metamodel used by the application.


## Technique

* [goalModel](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/src/goalModel): Contains the java implementation of the metamodel generated by genmodel.
* [src/VEGAN](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/src/VEGAN): Contains the implementation of the VeGAn technique.
* [VISUAL](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/src/VISUAL): Contains the interface part of the application.
* [piStar](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/src/piStar): Contains the implementation of the model import of the piStar tool.


## Testing

* [test](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/test/test): Contains jUnit Test of the application.
* [testModels](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/testModels): Contains models used for unit test.
* [piStar](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/piStar): Contains models from the piStar application for testing.
* [Examples of Goal Models](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/tree/main/GoalModel/Examples%20of%20Goal%20Models): Contains examples of goal models to analyze.
