# Installation Guide

There are two ways in which the VeGAn-Tool can be used.

On the one hand, the quick and easy way is to download the tool in executable form and run it.

On the other hand, you can download the tool code, compile it and run it.


Before you start installing the tool, check that you meet all the [requirements](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.md).


## Option 1: Download the executable

It is possible to directly download the executable of the tool and use it in such a way that it is not necessary to compile the tool.

[Download Link](https://github.com/CarlosCanoGenoves/VeGAn-Tool/releases)

Along with the tool executable are sample target models so you can test the tool.
