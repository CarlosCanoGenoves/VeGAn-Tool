# Requirements

There are two ways in which the VeGAn-Tool can be used.

On the one hand, the quick and easy way is to download the tool in executable form and run it.

On the other hand, you can download the tool code, compile it and run it.

Each of the different ways the tool can be used has different requirements:

## Execution Requirements:
The requirements to be able to **execute** the VeGAn-Tool without having to compile it are the following:

### Software Requirements: 
* [Java SE Runtime Environment Version 8 or higher](https://www.java.com/en/download/)

### Hardware Requirements: 
* Memory of more than 4GB (4GB is required to be assigned to the JVM)


## Building Requirements:
The requirements to be able to **build and execute** the VeGAn-Tool are the following:

### Software Requirements: 
* [Java SE Runtime Environment Version 8 or higher](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
* [Java JDK Version 17 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
* [Eclipse Modeling Tools 2023â€‘03](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2023-03/r/eclipse-modeling-tools): It is important to download the Eclipse version of modeling tools as it includes the plugins needed to compile the application.

* [Eclipse OCL Plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-ocl) **OPTIONAL**: The ecore metamodel includes OCL to validate the models in xmi as well as to generate some derived attributes. This plugin is not necessary to use the application, but it is recommended if you want to create new goal models since it can indicate errors and derived attributes help to better understand the model.


## Hardware Requirements: 
* Memory of more than 4GB (4GB is required to be assigned to the JVM)
